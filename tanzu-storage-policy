We had backed up namespace called core-support (this namespace currently utilizes File Mode PVC)
We created a new Storage policy with following parameters in the VCenter UI(Enable rules for vSAN storage >> Failure Tolerence=1, RAID = 1 Mirrored.)
Then added the new policy for storage provisioning in the Guest Cluster Storage in vCenter UI. (This generates block mode storage class in the Supervisor Cluster)
Invoked / created sc in the guest cluster referring supervisor Cluster Storage class. 
Tested the newly created Storage class for snapshot capabilities. 
Created a Transform set in Kasten that transforms old Storage Class "vsphere-with-tanzu-storage-policy" to new storage class "vsphere-block-sc".
Created Restore in Kasten UI and referenced the transform set created before. 
Performed the restore of core-support namespace to core-support-restore namespace 
The restore job successfully restored data to the block mode PVC. (App did not come up in running status due to lack of resources on the guest cluster.)
Created an S3 Location profile. 
Created 2ndary backup policy to test S3 Location Profile. (the export did not work again due to lack of resources on guest cluster.)
